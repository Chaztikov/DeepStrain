# DeepStrain
[Paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.730316/full)


Tensorflow implementation for cardiac segmentation, motion estimation, and strain analysis from cinematic magnetic resonance imaging (cine-MRI) data. For example,  given a 4D (3D+time) nifti dataset, our model is able to provide segmentations, motion estimates, and global measures of myocardial strain.

**Note**: The current software works well with Tensorflow 2.3.1+.
